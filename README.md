  About me!
</h1>

Hello, I’m Emanuel Perdigão. Even before starting my path in Automation, Robotics and Industrial Control, my intuition was pointing me in the direction of Programming. Nonetheless, the odds were against me. But, I like challenges. Having this as a background and taking with me problem-solving, logic and patience skills, here I am, taking my chances as a Full-Stack Developer.

- 💻 Full-Stack Developer
- 🏃 I’m always learning new things
- 👀 I’m currently looking for a job opportunity
- 💬 If you have any questions principle about Java feel free to ask
- 📫 Ping me at perdigaosfemanuel@gmail.com
